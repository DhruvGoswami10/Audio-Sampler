This is an Audio Sampler. It is used to create unique sounds from audio sources by manupulating the sounds waves and blending with other samples or instrunments to create something new.

### Description
There are 9 Pads from which you can assign any audio samples saved in your own PC or you have an option to record your won using the record feature. You can either press the record button or stop button manally or you can use press "R" to start recording and "S" to stop recording. 

You also have an option to save all your pads using save all feature. You will then be able to access them using the drop down menu and then by clicking your custom saved name. There is a detele option beside the saved name in case you want to delete that pad. You can also search your pad if you have a habit of saving all your files and in emergency don't have time to scroll through the junk.

There are 3 sliders at the bottom of the contorls: Pitch, Gain and Low Pass. Using these 3 sliders you can then adjust and modify your audio as you wish!

In order to use pads there are 2 options: Either you can press them maually if you have a touch screen device, do not recommend using mouse (You can if you want horrible experience) or you can press those fancy numerical buttons on your keyboard! 

That's IT! It is a simple audio sampler, nothing fancy and nothing crazy. It is for FUN PURPOSES ONLY! NOT FOR MUSIC PRODUCTION AND STUFF!!!
